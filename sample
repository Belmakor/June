We may\nmonitor or record calls for\nquality, security, and\ntraining.\nImportant information about the \nFinancial Services Compensation Scheme\nWe are covered by the Financial Services \nCompensation Scheme (FSCS).  The FSCS can pay \ncompensation to depositors if a bank is unable to \nmeet its financial obligations. Most depositors - \nincluding most individuals and small businesses - \nare covered by the scheme.\nIn respect of deposits, an eligible depositor is \nentitled to claim up to £85,000.  For joint accounts \neach account holder is treated as having a claim in \nrespect of their share so, for a joint account held by \ntwo eligible depositors, the maximum amount that \ncould be claimed would be £85,000 each (making a \ntotal of £170,000). The £85,000 limit relates to the \ncombined amount in all the eligible depositor's \naccounts with the bank, including their share of any \njoint account, and not to each separate account.\nFor further information about the compensation \nprovided by the FSCS (including the amounts \ncovered and eligibility to claim) please ask at your \nlocal branch, refer to the FSCS website \nwww.fscs.org.uk or call the FSCS on \n020 7741 4100 or 0800 678 1100. Please note only \ncompensation related queries should be directed to \nthe FSCS.\nBarclays Bank PLC may also accept deposits under \nthe following trading names; Barclays, Barclays \nBank, Barclaycard, Barclays Business, Barclays \nCapital, Barclays Corporate, Barclays Direct, Barclays \nUK & Ireland Private Bank, Barclays International \nPrivate Banking, Barclays Premier, Barclays Private \nBank, Barclays Wealth, Woolwich Mortgages. \nDeposits accepted from an eligible depositor under \nthese trading names are combined for the purposes \nof deposit compensation from the FSCS. The FSCS is \nnot applicable to deposits held at branches in the \nChannel Islands or the Isle of Man.\nUsing your Barclays debit card \n- what costs and what doesn't\nIf you use your debit card in the UK:Barclays will \nnot charge you for using your debit card in the UK \nwhen making purchases, withdrawing cash, or when \nbuying travellers' cheques or foreign currency. A small \nnumber of ATM providers may charge a transaction \nfee but they should tell you about this on-screen \nbefore you commit to any transaction.\nIf you use your debit card abroad or pay in a \ncurrency other than sterling (either abroad or in the \nUK):Barclays will charge you a 2.99% Non-Sterling \nTransaction Fee for using your debit card abroad \nwhen making purchases, withdrawing cash, or when \nyou are being refunded. This fee will also apply \nwhenever you do not pay in sterling, for example \nwhen you shop online at a non-UK website. On top of \nthis, if you're getting cash over the counter at a bank \nabroad (including Barclays), or using an ATM other \nthan a Barclays ATM or an ATM at a Global Alliance \nmember bank, you'll also be charged a £1.50 \nNon-Sterling Cash Fee and the ATM provider may \napply other charges. To see a full list of Global Alliance \nmember banks and countries go to \nbarclays.co.uk/globalalliance. Visa converts \ntransactions into sterling using the Visa Exchange \nRate on the day it processes the transaction. This date \nmay be different to the day on which the transaction 	took place. Historic exchange rate information is \navailable on visaeurope.com.  For more info please go \nto barclays.co.uk/debitcardsabroad\nTransferring money between countries\nIf you need to transfer money between countries, you\nmay be asked for your SWIFTBIC (Bank Identification\nCode) and IBAN (International Bank Account\nNumber). These are on the front of your statement\nand you'll need them so that international banks can\nidentify your account correctly. Full details are on:\nbusiness.barclays.co.uk/bb/iban\nHow we pay interest\nIf your account pays interest and is in credit, we work \nout your interest on the balance of your account at the \nclose of business every day. Interest is calculated on \nthe statement balance or the cleared balance, \ndepending on the type of account you have. Where \ncredit interest rate(s) are shown on your statement, \nthese are current at the time of printing the statement \nand may have changed during the statement period. \nUnless we say otherwise, any interest rates we show \nare gross annual rates.\nIf you're a UK taxpayer, your interest is subject to \nincome tax. Your statement will show how much tax \nwe've deducted at the basic rate. If you declare you're \nnot liable for UK income tax (call us to find out how), \nwe can pay your interest without these deductions.\nGetting information from Barclays\nWe send information to customers with their \nstatements about relevant new offers and products, \nand about how to get the best from their existing \nBarclays accounts. If you don't get these messages \nand you'd like to, or if you do and you'd rather you \ndidn't, you can call 0845 7 555 555, go to \nbarclays.co.uk, or come into a branch. And if you \nchange your mind at any time, just get in touch.\nHow it works	Get in touch
