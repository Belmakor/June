- If:
	(i) there is an empty cell in the header row
	(ii) that row's column does not collide with an adjacent header's column
   Then they shall be collapsed into one column.
   > And if there are TWO??? That would be unfortunate. It'll have to be done across all empty header cells at once to determine the strategy.
